# Pathfinder 2e Counteract Calculator

The counteract rules are probably the most confusing rules in Pathfinder 2e. This app was created to guide players on determining the success or failure of a counteract check. The tool will also explain in clear language how all of the calculations were made.  

## Counteract Rules and Inspiration

- The rules for Counteracting on [Archives of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=3280&Redirected=1)
- The [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/13pyaky/a_visual_guide_to_counteract_checks/) that made the counteract rules click for me.
